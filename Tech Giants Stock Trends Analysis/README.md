# Apple-Google-Meta-Stock-Prices-Analysis Power BI Portfolio Project

## üìä **Project Overview**

This project involves the analysis and visualization of historical stock prices for three major tech giants‚Äî**Apple (AAPL)**, **Google (GOOGL)**, and **Meta (META)**. Using data spanning from **September 7, 2017**, to **September 7, 2022**, the goal was to explore relationships, trends, and correlations among the stock prices of these companies.

The Power BI dashboard provides detailed insights into stock prices and trading volumes over five years, helping stakeholders to understand the market behavior and performance of these tech giants.

## üéØ **Business Problem**

As a **Data Analyst**, the task was to develop an interactive and insightful **Power BI dashboard** that answers the following key business questions:

1. **How have the stock prices (Open & Close) of Apple, Google, and Meta evolved over the years?**
2. **What are the highest and lowest stock prices for each company during the period?**
3. **How do the adjusted closing prices compare, accounting for dividends and stock splits?**
4. **What trends can be observed in trading volumes for each company?**

The primary aim was to perform a year-by-year analysis to identify trends, correlations, and patterns across these companies.
